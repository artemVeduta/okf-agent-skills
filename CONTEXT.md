# OKF Agent Skills

This context defines the language used to design lifecycle-aware agent skills
for Open Knowledge Format documentation.

## Language

**Code-backed project**:
A project in which executable behavior is represented by code. Code is
authoritative for that behavior, while OKF records durable context that cannot
be recovered adequately from the code.
_Avoid_: Code project

**Knowledge-only project**:
A project whose durable knowledge is represented entirely by documents rather
than executable code. Its OKF bundle is the complete source of truth.
_Avoid_: Obsidian project, docs-only repository

**Durable context**:
Knowledge that should remain available across agent sessions because it
clarifies domain language, intent, rationale, constraints, invariants, or
workflows without duplicating implementation.
_Avoid_: Documentation of the code, prose mirror

**Automatic lifecycle**:
The recurring behavior through which an agent consults relevant OKF knowledge
and maintains small, evidence-backed documentation changes while doing normal
project work.
_Avoid_: Automatic full sync

**Trust tier**:
An advisory classification of the verification evidence recorded for a
concept. A trust tier does not grant authority to mutate the concept; operation
risk and project mode determine the required safeguards.
_Avoid_: Permission level, operator trust

**OKF specification version**:
The upstream Open Knowledge Format version, such as v0.2, that defines format
semantics. It is independent of the suite release version.
_Avoid_: Format release, suite version

**Suite release version**:
The version of `okf-agent-skills`, such as v0.1.0. It records which reviewed OKF
specification revision the product implements but does not name the format.
_Avoid_: OKF version, specification version

**Bundle conformance**:
Satisfaction of the structural tests defined by an identified OKF
specification version. Product policy and migration fidelity are separate.
_Avoid_: Overall validity, suite compatibility

**Producer obligation**:
An OKF requirement governing authored content or producer behavior that is not
necessarily a bundle-conformance test.
_Avoid_: Conformance test, product rule

**Consumer tolerance**:
Required or recommended behavior when reading optional, unknown, legacy, or
broken OKF content without treating that content as a mutation target.
_Avoid_: Automatic repair, conformance waiver

**Suite profile**:
The two rules `okf-agent-skills` imposes beyond OKF conformance: mutation
requires an exact `okf_version: "0.2"` bundle-root declaration, and a rewrite
must reproduce the frontmatter's parsed semantics through the suite's own
writer. Reported with origin `suite`, never as an OKF conformance error.
_Avoid_: OKF conformance, product extension

**Semantic preservation**:
Retention of YAML key names, scalar types and values, sequence order, and
mapping structure without promising preservation of comments or formatting.
_Avoid_: Lexical preservation, byte-for-byte round trip
